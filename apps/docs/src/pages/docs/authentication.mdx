# Authentication

You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the endpoints in the Highstorm API. In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Bearer Token

When establishing a connection using OAuth2, you will need your access token — you will find it in the [Dashboard](#) in the settings when you click on your profile picture. Here's how to add the token to the request header using cURL:

```bash {{ title: 'Example request with bearer token' }}
curl https://api.highstorm.app/v1/events/{channel} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

Always keep your token safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.
