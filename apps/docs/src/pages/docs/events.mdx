# Events

Events are the core of Highstorm. They are the building blocks of your timeline. Events are created by ingesting them to Highstorm. You can do this by using the API endpoint below or by using one of our integrations.

## The event model

Internally an event looks like the following:

### Properties

<Properties>

  <Property name="channelId" type="string">
    The channel that the event belongs to.
  </Property>
   <Property name="tenantId" type="string">
    The tenant that the event belongs to.
  </Property>
  <Property name="id" type="string">
    Unique identifier for this event, generated by Highstorm.
  </Property>
  <Property name="time" type="int">
    Timestamp of when the event was created (Unix timestamp in milliseconds). If not provided, the current time will be used.
  </Property>
  <Property name="event" type="string">
    What happened. Keep it short and descriptive.
  </Property>
  <Property name="content" type="string">
    The content of the event. This can be as long as you want.
  </Property>
  <Property name="metadata" type="{ key: value }">
    Arbitrary key value data, you can use this to store any additional information.
  </Property>
</Properties>
