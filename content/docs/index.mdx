This is **NOT** a component library.

It's a collection of re-usable components built using [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's a work in progress and I'm adding components as I need them.

**All components are compatible with Next.js 13 (Client & Server Components).**

## FAQs

### What do you mean by not a component library?

I mean you do not install it as a dependency.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

**Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries.**

### What is this based on?

The primitives are from [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com/). I use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

Go say hi to the Radix team. They're awesome.

### Why did you build this?

I'm working on several open source products. I needed components that maintain a unified design style across all my products.

### Is it available as an npm package?

No. I have no plans to publish it as an npm package (right now).

If you want to publish it to npm, you're free to do so. The code is open source.

### Why copy/paste and not install as a dependency?

The idea behind this is to give you ownership and control over the code, allowing you to decide how the components are constructed and styled.

We start with some sensible defaults, but you can customize the components to your needs.

One of the drawback of packaging the components in an npm package is that the style is coupled with the implementation.

_The design of your components should be separate from their implementation._

### The design looks great. Did you design this yourself?

I did. But I'm not really a designer. Most of what you see here, I learned by looking at other component libraries and "copying" them.

### Is it ready for production?

Yes. You can use it in your production apps.

### How do I customize the colors?

I use slate for everything. But you can customize the colors by editing the `tailwind.config.js` file.

See the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) for more information.

### Can I contribute?

Of course. You can open an issue or submit a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/shadcn/ui).

### Can I use this in my project?

Yes. Free to use for personal and commercial projects. No attribution required.

But hey, let me know if you do. I'd love to see what you build.
